# GRN-inference-using-GNN
Implementation code from paper Reconstruction Of Gene Regulatory Networks Using Graph Neural Networks

The datasets are provided in the data folder.
The Preprocessing.ipynb code can be run to construct the graph structures from gene expression data[Optional].
The GNN based GRN inference.ipynb file can be run to see the results
